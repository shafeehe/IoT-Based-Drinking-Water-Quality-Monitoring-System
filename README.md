# IoT-Based-Drinking-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System
IoT based drinking water quality monitering system using ESP32 and ThinkSpeak IoT platform.
Here we have used 3 sensors to take reading of respective parameters. That is 
1) DS18B20 temperature sensor
2) TDS Analogue Module
3) Turbidity sensor.
Thus we monitor the quality of the drinking water by monitering these parameters respective to its safe level for a drinkable water.

Us, comprising of myself, Sarang T Mahesh, Niranjan S Prasad and Jasir Nufaiz have successfully presented and demonstrated before the Project Panel of ECE Dept. Govt. Engineering College Kannur.
